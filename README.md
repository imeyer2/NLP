# PyTorch SOO: Second Order Optimizers in PyTorch
This repository is intended to enable the use of second-order (i.e. including curvature information)
optimizers in PyTorch. This can be for machine learning applications or for generic optimization
problems.

There is also a significant body of code used for running and analyzing experiments for
understanding the convergence properties of these optimizers as applied to machine learning.

Further documentation, examples, and overall clean-up of the API is forthcoming. Please feel free to
open issues and PR's as required on [GitHub](https://github.com/pnnl/pytorch_soo).
